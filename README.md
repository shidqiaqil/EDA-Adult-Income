# Exploratory Data Analysis for Adult Income Prediction

This repository contains my work on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for adult income prediction. In this project, I have analyzed the UCI Machine Learning Repository's "Adult" dataset to gain insights into factors influencing income levels.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** To perform EDA on the Adult dataset and understand the relationships between various features and income levels.

- **Dataset:** The [Adult dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult) is provided by the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains various demographic and socioeconomic attributes.

## Project Highlights

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Conducted in-depth EDA to visualize and analyze features such as age, education, work hours, and their impact on income.

3. **Visualizations:** Utilized various data visualization libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) to create informative plots and graphs.

4. Explore the Jupyter Notebook (adult_income_eda.ipynb) to see the detailed EDA process and findings.
